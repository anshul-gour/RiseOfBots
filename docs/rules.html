    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><font size="4">Edans</font></u> ::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team has 3 edans (or men).</li>
      <li>Edans have 100 hit points initially.</li>
      <li>When hit points are exhausted, the edan dies( losing 10 score points). But, there is life after 
      death! 
    That edan is reborn at a random location after 600 game time.<font size="3" type="Times New Roman"> 
      Whenever an edan dies it loses&nbsp; its resource, which falls on the point 
      where it dies. If the edan is dead then all it's functions are blocked.</font></li>
      <li>Edan can move in 0.000- 23.999 in X &amp; also in Y direction.</li>
      <li>If an edan hits a wall 
      or obstacle, its hit points are reduced by one. Also its team score is reduced by 
      one point.</li>
      <li><font size="3" type="Times New Roman">Whenever a moving edan hits 
      another edan (same or different&nbsp; team), both of them suffer a damage of 2 
      and they stop right there. The edan which is trying to hit has a team 
      score reduced by one. If the edan hits a nost it suffers a damage of 
      1 &amp; stops right there.</font></li>
      <li>The move speed is 0.33 every 3 game time. If it has resource the speed will be 75% 
      of normal speed. </li>
      <li>A edan can scan the arena for enemy edans, resources and nosts. Edan can 
      scan +20 to -20 direction with a scan range of&nbsp; 7 units. His view&nbsp; 
      will be blocked by walls.</li>
      <li>The edan can be upgraded or enriched with special powers also it's hit 
      points increase by 50 but cannot exceed 100.&nbsp; Look out for 
      special powers, given below.</li>
      <li>An edan can send messages to and receive messages from 
      edans in his team.</li>
      <li>An edan is deactivated if it makes an unusual request to the combat 
      server. </li>
      <li>If an edan deactivates (=death; there is no life after deactivation) during the game, the team score will be 
      decreased by 250.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><u><b>Resources</b></u>::</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are 3 kinds of resources namely&nbsp; vasa, tathar and malda.</li>
      <li>Resources will be generated at random points in the arena </li>
      <li>New resource of a kind will be generated at regular intervals of time 
      (1000 game time) 
      only if the previously generated resource is taken from it's first 
      allotted 
      location.</li>
      <li>To pick up a resource, an edan has to go to the coordinates where the 
      resource lies.</li>
      <li>If an edan has a resource then it can't move over a resource lying in arena, if 
      it hits a resource its hit points decrease by one .</li>
      <li>Edan can keep a resource at any unblocked coordinate (where there is 
      no wall,  nost or another resource) or pass it to his teammate (edan 
      or Nost) which should not more than distance 4.</li>
      <li>Edans can build a new nost at the expense of 1 unit each of all three 
      type of&nbsp; resources.</li>
      <li>Edans can acquire special powers for a short time (800 game time) at 
      the expense of one resource, e.g. at the expense of&nbsp; vasa, an edan move with double of 
      it's speed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      <li><u>A resource can be used by a team if it is inside one of the nosts 
      only.</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><u><b>Nost</b></u> ::</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>To start with, every team will have 1 nost at a random location. </li>
      <li>This nost will have 500 hit points in starting. </li>
      <li>Hit points reduce when bombed. </li>
      <li>A nost can increase its hit points (500 hit points) by utilizing a 
      resource. </li>
      <li>If the nost has more than 500 hit points, the hit points will decrease 
      with game time as per 3 game time 1 with a team score up of 0.2&nbsp; per 3 
      game time. The nost is in Second stage. The nost is in Third stage if it 
      has more than 1000 hit points, now the hit point decreasing rate is double 
      with score up 0.5. </li>
      <li>If the nost has hit points less than 50 it can't garrison resources, 
      so you can't upgrade your nost in this situation but the nost gains hit 
      points one in 12 game time with an -2 of&nbsp; team score loss. </li>
      <li>Edans can not enter nosts. </li>
      <li>New nosts can be built using resources, as already stated. </li>
      <li><u>If a team does not have any nost all it's teammate will 
      deactivated.</u> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b><font size="4">Bomb</font></b></u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edans can throw bombs in any direction up to a certain range.</li>
      <li>A non upgraded edan (stage 1) can throw bomb up to 3 while an edan upgraded 
      with ballisto can throw up to 6 blocks distance.</li>
      <li>Bomb will cause a hit point decrease in both edans &amp; nost. </li>
      <li>A bomb explodes in two stages. It lasts for <u>6</u> gametime.</li>
      <li>First stage affects edans or nosts in one block of area and has 
      attack of 2.</li>
      <li>Second stage affects a square of side 3 and has attack of 1. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p><b><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Special Powers:</u></font></b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Temporary powers:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using vasa, an edan can acquire <u><i>Speed</i></u> power i.e. its 
      speed is doubled for a period of 800 gametime. </li>
      <li>An edan can double his bombing power (<u><i>Ballisto</i></u>) making use 
      of Tathar. </li>
      <li>It can also <u><i>Shield</i></u> itself from all bombing attacks for 
      800 gametime at the expense of Malda.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; II. <u><b>&nbsp;Permanent Powers</b></u>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u><i>Turbo:</i></u> This power enables all edans of a team to move 
      with double the normal speed. To get it, a team should have&nbsp; 3 units of 
      vasa in a nost. </li>
      <li><u><i>Ranged Bomb</i></u>: Bombing range of all edans in a team doubles 
      permanently. It takes three tathar to acquire this power. </li>
      <li><u><i>Golden eye:</i></u> This allows all edans of a team to know 
      position of all enemy edans at every gametime. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u><font size="4">Objectives of the GAME
    </font></u><font size="4">&nbsp;::</font></b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all nosts of a team are destroyed, 
    it is GAME OVER (i.e. also a loss of 750 due to deactivation)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such a condition does not happen during the game, 
    the the game will last for 12000 gametime.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But remember that even then the team with more 
    point wins.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4">A team wins score points for:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>As many points reduced by hitting due to bombing an enemy edan.</li>
      <li>Picking up a resource which is not picked up from any one since it is 
      generated or left by the Enemy Team. (+100)</li>
      <li>Building a nost(+300)</li>
      <li>Upgrading the edan will give 300 score points.</li>
      <li>The gain in Nost's score when its hit points are more than 500.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; A team loses score points for</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>As many hit points lost due to bombing by own teammates.</li>
      <li>If your edan is dead it's score decreased by 10.</li>
      <li>If your nost is loss all it's hit points it's score reduced by 200. </li>
      <li>getting deactivated in during the game (-250)</li>
      <li>Hitting walls or obstacles, Nost, other edan in arena (-1)</li>
      <li>If Nost's health is less than 100, it looses score accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Edan loses life for :</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>getting bombed</li>
      <li>hitting wall, resources (if it's carrying one and hits the one on 
      ground), nosts (-1) , other edans (-2) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Hit points can be increased:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>By an Edan when he uses a resource (hitpoints+=50 or hitpoints=100, 
      whichever is less)</li>
      <li>If nost is upgraded, it wins a life of&nbsp; (+500)</li>
