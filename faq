FAQ

1. What map will be used for Shaastra 2004 (Oct. 8th to 11th) at IIT Madras?

Ans.

We will be using any random map it may be from maps folder or may not.

2. How do I extract the contents of the archive 'riseofbots-x.xx.tar.gz'?

Ans.

In Linux, you can do this by changing the directory to the one which
holds the archive, and then typing the command 'tar -xvzf riseofbots.x.xx.tar.gz'.
This will create the directory riseofbots-x.xx and extract the files within it.

In Windows, you will need some program to extract gz files. The popular
archiver WinZip is capable of doing this. Open the archive in WinZip and
then click Extract. Make sure that the checkbox 'Use Folder Names' is checked
and then type in the destination directory in the Extract to textbox.

3. When I try to build the binaries in Linux, I get messages saying
   'Invalid Interpreter'.

Ans. This is most probably caused because you extracted the archive in Windows
and then are accessing it through Linux. Due to this, the line endings mark is
CR+LF, whereas Linux needs a line ending mark of just CR. To fix this,
re-extract the archive contents in Linux itself, as described above.

4. The combat server complains that the blank map included is an invalid mapfile.

Ans. This is also most probably due to the above problem. Try re-extracting
the archive in Linux.

See the file readme for more details. Please note that the Windows version
has been found to run substantially slower than the Linux version.
