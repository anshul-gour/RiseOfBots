History of the event
I.
Shaastra is a world driven by highly intelectual people like Ayan Chakravarty.
Ayan Chakravaty was the creator of this bots world during a period of renaissance of Shaastra in 2002. But somehow this bots world went out of his control and a civil war started in it.In the early stage of this civil war, bots carried flags and bombed other bots.
.
II
As this civil war advanced in the next Shaastra, bots advanced technologically. The complexity in AI increased.
Now, they had a very powerful tool of communication. They started fighting with advanced stratigies. Some survived, others withered.

III.
In the early stage of third age of civil war bots evolved into edans .
An edan is a very advanced version of a bot. Edans have discovered new resources viz. vasa, malda and tathar. Now they can acquire great powers using these resources (to hunt down enemy edans they can spy, move faster and attack with greater strength).So strong are these powers, they can destroy whole bots world. To save this world of bots we need a hero, can ur edans be THE ONE...
